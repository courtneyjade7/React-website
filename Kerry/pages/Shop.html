            <p>I have been a graphic designer for over 10 years and while creating my own wedding stationery, I thought to myself how lucky am I to be able to design my own stationery. As the costs to get someone else to design everything to look the same can be high and is not really something one would want to drop a heavy dime on. So with brides on a budget in mind. I design bespoke, boutique style  wedding stationery suites. These are designed in Adobe Illustrator and then converted into Microsoft word. They are easily edited in Microsoft word and can be made into emailers or printed on your home printer. I have designed each package with so much love, as if I were designing them for someone dear to me. Which is why my packages are named after all the beautiful women in my life. I hope you find something that suits you and your partner's wedding perfectly! xxx Kez </p>
